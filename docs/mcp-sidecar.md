# MCP Sidecar

pg_sage includes a thin Go sidecar that exposes the extension's capabilities via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) over HTTP+SSE. This lets AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot) interact with your database through pg_sage.

---

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. It uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication.

The pg_sage sidecar implements the MCP specification, exposing database health, findings, schema information, and diagnostic tools as MCP resources and tools.

---

## Running the Sidecar

### With Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts both the PostgreSQL + pg_sage container and the sidecar.

### Standalone

```bash
export SAGE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"
export SAGE_MCP_PORT=5433
export SAGE_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9187
cd sidecar && go build -o sage-sidecar . && ./sage-sidecar
```

## Tools

MCP tools allow AI assistants to invoke actions. Clients call tools via `tools/call` requests.

### `diagnose`

Interactive diagnostic analysis via ReAct reasoning. The LLM reasons through problems step by step, executing follow-up SQL queries autonomously.

**Input:**

```json
{ "question": "Why are my queries slow today?" }
```

**Output:** Natural-language analysis with SQL evidence and recommendations.

### `briefing`

Generate an on-demand health briefing of the current database state.

**Input:** None required.

**Output:** Structured health report covering findings, performance metrics, and recommendations.

### `suggest_index`

Get index recommendations for a specific table based on query patterns and current index coverage.

**Input:**

```json
{ "table": "public.orders" }
```

**Output:** Suggested CREATE INDEX statements with rationale.

### `review_migration`

Review DDL or migration SQL for production safety issues (locking, long-running operations, data loss risks).

**Input:**

```json
{ "ddl": "ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN status text DEFAULT 'pending';" }
```

**Output:** Risk assessment with specific warnings and safer alternatives.

## Prompts

MCP prompts provide pre-built conversation templates that AI assistants can use.

| Prompt | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `investigate_slow_query` | `queryid` (required) | Investigate why a specific query is slow |
| `review_schema` | `table` (required) | Review the schema design of a table |
| `capacity_plan` | none | Analyze current database capacity and growth trends |

### Example: `investigate_slow_query`

```json
{
  "name": "investigate_slow_query",
  "arguments": { "queryid": "1234567890" }
}
```

Returns a prompt message instructing the AI to examine the execution plan, table statistics, and index usage for the specified query.

---

## Authentication

Set the `SAGE_API_KEY` environment variable to require authentication:

```bash
export SAGE_API_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

When set, all MCP requests must include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key
```

!!! warning
    Without `SAGE_API_KEY` set, the sidecar accepts unauthenticated requests. Always set an API key in production.

---

## Rate Limiting

The sidecar implements a sliding-window rate limiter per client IP:

- Default: 60 requests per minute per IP
- Configurable via `SAGE_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable
- Respects `X-Forwarded-For` header for proxied clients
- Rate-limited requests receive HTTP 429 with a JSON error body
- Rate limit events are logged to `sage.mcp_log` (or `public.sage_mcp_log` in sidecar-only mode)

```json
{"error": "rate limit exceeded"}
```

---

## Prometheus Metrics

The sidecar exposes Prometheus metrics at `:9187/metrics`.

|---|---|---|
| `pg_sage_info{version}` | gauge | Extension version |
| `pg_sage_findings_total{severity}` | gauge | Open findings by severity (critical, warning, info) |

## Sidecar-Only Mode for Managed Databases

When connected to a managed database (RDS, Aurora, Cloud SQL) without the pg_sage extension installed, the sidecar automatically detects the absence and falls back to direct catalog queries.

In sidecar-only mode:

- MCP resources work using direct SQL against `pg_stat_*` views
- Prometheus metrics are generated from catalog queries
- Tools that depend on the extension (`diagnose`, `briefing`) are unavailable
- No background workers, rules engine, or action executor

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  -e SAGE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@your-rds-host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require" \
  -p 5433:5433 -p 9187:9187 \
  sidecar
```

!!! note
    Sidecar-only mode is a monitoring-only configuration. For the full pg_sage experience including automated analysis and remediation, install the C extension on a self-managed PostgreSQL instance.

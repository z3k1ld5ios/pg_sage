# pg_sage Walkthrough -- Windows

Your database has been silently accumulating problems: duplicate indexes burning
write I/O, sequences about to overflow, queries doing full table scans on 100K
rows. In the next 10 minutes, pg_sage will find all of them and tell you exactly
how to fix each one.

**Time**: ~10 minutes

**Prerequisites**:

- A PostgreSQL 14-17 database you can connect to
- PowerShell or Git Bash
- `psql` client (ships with PostgreSQL installer)

If you have a local PostgreSQL on port 5432, you can use it directly. Otherwise,
start one via Docker Desktop:

```powershell
docker run -d --name pg-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=testpass `
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:17 `
  -c shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements
```

---

## 1. Download and Start

### PowerShell

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/jasonmassie01/pg_sage/releases/latest/download/pg_sage_windows_amd64.exe -OutFile pg_sage.exe
```

### Git Bash

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/jasonmassie01/pg_sage/releases/latest/download/pg_sage_windows_amd64.exe -o pg_sage.exe
```

Create the database user (connect with a superuser):

```cmd
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "CREATE USER sage_agent WITH PASSWORD 'sagepw'; GRANT pg_monitor TO sage_agent; GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO sage_agent; GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO sage_agent; GRANT pg_signal_backend TO sage_agent;"
```

Start pg_sage:

```cmd
pg_sage.exe --pg-url "postgres://sage_agent:sagepw@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

pg_sage connects, bootstraps the `sage` schema, and starts collecting. Leave it
running in this terminal.

---

## 2. Check Findings

Open a second terminal and connect to the database:

```cmd
psql -h localhost -U sage_agent -d postgres
```

Wait about 2 minutes for the first analyzer cycle, then:

```sql
SELECT category, severity, title
FROM sage.findings
WHERE status = 'open'
ORDER BY
  CASE severity WHEN 'critical' THEN 1 WHEN 'warning' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END;
```

You will see findings for any detected issues -- duplicate indexes, unused
indexes, slow queries, sequence exhaustion, cache hit ratio, etc.

Every finding comes with a fix and a rollback:

```sql
SELECT title, recommended_sql, rollback_sql
FROM sage.findings
WHERE severity = 'critical' AND status = 'open';
```

---

## 3. Enable LLM (Optional)

Create a `config.yaml`:

```yaml
mode: standalone

postgres:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  user: sage_agent
  password: sagepw
  database: postgres

llm:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai"
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
  optimizer:
    enabled: true

trust:
  level: observation
```

Restart pg_sage with the config:

```cmd
pg_sage.exe --config config.yaml
```

---

## 4. Check the Action Log

```sql
SELECT id, action_type, finding_id, outcome, executed_at
FROM sage.action_log
ORDER BY executed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

In observation mode (the default), no actions are taken. Promote to `advisory`
in the config to allow safe actions like dropping duplicate indexes.

---

## 5. Prometheus Metrics

Open a second terminal:

```cmd
curl -s http://localhost:9187/metrics
```

If `curl` is not available, use PowerShell:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:9187/metrics).Content
```

Output includes:

```
pg_sage_findings_total{severity="critical"} 2
pg_sage_findings_total{severity="warning"} 4
pg_sage_findings_total{severity="info"} 1
pg_sage_connection_up 1
```

---

## 6. Web UI

pg_sage serves a React dashboard on port 8080 (configurable). Open
`http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see findings, actions, forecasts,
query hints, and manage configuration.

The REST API is available at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/` for programmatic
access. See the [API Endpoints](../README.md#api-endpoints) section for the
full list.

---

## 7. Clean Up

Stop pg_sage with Ctrl+C. To remove the sage schema:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA sage CASCADE;
```

If using the test Docker container:

```cmd
docker rm -f pg-test
```

---

## Windows-Specific Notes

- **Port conflicts**: A local PostgreSQL install binds port 5432. Either use it
  directly (recommended) or stop the service: `net stop postgresql-x64-17`.
- **Docker Desktop**: Make sure Docker Desktop is running before starting containers.
- **curl**: Windows 10+ includes curl. If not found, use PowerShell's
  `Invoke-WebRequest` or install via `winget install curl`.
- **Firewall**: Windows Firewall may prompt for access when pg_sage starts
  listening on ports 5433, 8080, and 9187.

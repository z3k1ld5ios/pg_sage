**Autonomous PostgreSQL DBA Agent** -- a native C extension that continuously monitors, analyzes, and maintains your PostgreSQL database.

pg_sage runs inside PostgreSQL as three background workers and exposes its capabilities through SQL functions in the `sage` schema. It combines a deterministic rules engine with optional LLM-enhanced analysis and a trust-ramped action executor that gradually earns autonomy over time.

All Tier 1 analysis runs without any external dependencies. LLM integration is optional and only enhances Tier 2 features (briefings, diagnose, explain narrative).

## How pg_sage Is Different

The Postgres AI tooling space is heating up. Here's where pg_sage fits:

| | **pg_sage** | **Xata Agent** | **PostgresAI** | **pg-aiguide** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Native C extension + background workers inside Postgres | External Docker container connecting to Postgres | External CLI/Docker + Grafana stack | MCP server plugin for AI coding tools |
| **Runs inside Postgres** | ✅ Extension (`CREATE EXTENSION pg_sage`) | ❌ Separate container | ❌ Separate process | ❌ External MCP server |
| **Autonomous actions** | ✅ Trust-ramped executor (observe → advise → act) | ❌ Suggests only | ❌ Suggests only | ❌ Not applicable (schema guidance only) |
| **Continuous monitoring** | ✅ Background workers with configurable intervals | ✅ Scheduled checks | ✅ Continuous via monitoring stack | ❌ On-demand only |
| **Rules engine (no LLM needed)** | ✅ Full Tier 1 runs with zero external dependencies | ⚠️ Playbooks guide LLM reasoning | ⚠️ Checkup rules + LLM analysis | ❌ LLM-dependent |
| **LLM provider** | Pluggable — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Claude, GPT, Ollama, local models) | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek | LLM-agnostic piping | Claude Code / Cursor integration |
| **Self-hosted / air-gapped** | ✅ Tier 1 works fully offline; Tier 2 works with local Ollama | ✅ Self-hosted container | ✅ Self-hosted | ⚠️ Requires cloud MCP endpoint |
| **Data leaves your server** | ❌ EXPLAIN plans + schema metadata only (to LLM, if enabled) | ⚠️ Query patterns sent to LLM | ⚠️ Health data piped to LLM | ⚠️ Schema sent to MCP server |
| **Graduated trust model** | ✅ 30-day ramp: Observation → Advisory → Autonomous | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Circuit breaker** | ✅ Automatic + manual emergency stop | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **License** | AGPL-3.0 | Apache-2.0 | Various (open source) | PostgreSQL License |

**The short version:** Most Postgres AI tools are external processes that observe your database and suggest fixes. pg_sage is a native extension that *lives inside* your database, earns trust over time, and eventually handles routine DBA work autonomously — with a kill switch you control.

---

## Why pg_sage Exists

I've spent 25 years as a DBA and Solutions Architect at Google Cloud, AWS, IBM, and Verizon — managing, tuning, and firefighting PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL in production. Every "AI for databases" tool I've evaluated falls into one of two traps:

1. **SaaS dashboards** that want your query telemetry shipped to their cloud. Enterprises won't do this. Banks won't do this. Anyone who cares about data sovereignty won't do this.
2. **One-shot tuners** that optimize your config once and collect dust. OtterTune proved this model doesn't stick — they shut down after struggling to retain users post-initial-tune.

pg_sage takes a different approach: it's a native Postgres extension that runs as background workers *inside your database*. It starts in observation mode, builds a baseline of your workload patterns, and gradually earns autonomy to handle routine maintenance — dropping unused indexes, tuning autovacuum, flagging regressions — the same work a senior DBA does every morning with their coffee.

The LLM integration is optional and pluggable. Point it at Claude, GPT-4, or a local Ollama instance running Qwen. Your EXPLAIN plans and schema metadata are the only things that leave the server — never your actual data.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonmassie01/pg_sage.git
cd pg_sage
docker compose up
```

Once the container is running:

```bash
docker exec -it pg_sage-pg_sage-1 psql -U postgres
```

```sql
-- Extension is auto-loaded via shared_preload_libraries
-- Check system status
SELECT * FROM sage.status();

-- See what pg_sage found
SELECT category, severity, title FROM sage.findings WHERE status = 'open' ORDER BY severity;

-- Get a health briefing
SELECT sage.briefing();
```

Example output after ~60 seconds:

```
 category            | severity | title
---------------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------
 duplicate_index     | critical | Duplicate index public.idx_orders_dup2 matches idx_orders_dup1
 sequence_exhaustion | critical | Sequence public.orders_seq at 93.1% capacity (integer)
 config              | warning  | shared_buffers below recommended 25% of RAM
 security_missing_rls| warning  | Table public.customers has sensitive columns but no RLS
 unused_index        | warning  | Unused index public.idx_old on public.orders (zero scans)
 config              | info     | max_connections significantly exceeds peak usage
```

### What You'll See

After the extension loads and the first collector/analyzer cycle completes (~60 seconds), `sage.status()` returns:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "trust_level": "observation",
  "uptime_seconds": 67,
  "collector": {"status": "running", "last_run": "2026-03-21T12:00:30Z", "snapshots": 2},
  "analyzer": {"status": "running", "last_run": "2026-03-21T12:01:00Z", "findings": 4},
  "circuit_breaker": {"db_ops": "closed", "llm": "closed"},
  "llm_enabled": false
}
```

Check findings:

```sql
SELECT severity, category, title, recommendation
FROM sage.findings
ORDER BY severity DESC;
```

## Architecture

| | pg_sage | pganalyze | OtterTune / DBtune |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs inside Postgres** | Native C extension, zero external infra | SaaS agent + cloud dashboard | Cloud-only SaaS |
| **Takes action** | Trust-ramped autonomous remediation | Recommendations only | Knob tuning only |
| **Self-hosted** | Fully, AGPL-3.0 | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| **LLM dependency** | Optional (Tier 1 works without it) | N/A | Required |

---

## Architecture

pg_sage implements a three-tier architecture:

### Tier 1 -- Rules Engine

Deterministic checks that run every analyzer interval, no LLM required:

| Category | What it detects |
|---|---|
| **Index health** | Duplicate indexes, unused indexes, missing indexes, index bloat |
| **Query performance** | Slow queries, query regressions, sequential scans on large tables |
| **Sequences** | Approaching exhaustion (bigint/int overflow) |
| **Maintenance** | Vacuum needs, table bloat, dead tuple accumulation, XID wraparound |
| **Configuration** | Audit of `postgresql.conf` against best practices |
| **Security** | Overprivileged roles, missing RLS on sensitive tables |
| **Replication** | Lag monitoring, inactive slots, WAL archiving staleness |
| **Self-monitoring** | Extension health, circuit breaker status, schema footprint |

### Tier 2 -- LLM-Enhanced Analysis

Optional features that use an external LLM for natural-language intelligence:

- **Daily briefings** -- summarized health reports delivered on schedule
- **Interactive diagnose** -- ReAct loop that reasons through problems step by step, executing follow-up SQL queries autonomously
- **Explain narrative** -- human-readable query plan analysis via `sage.explain(queryid)`
- **Cost attribution** -- map storage and IOPS costs to unused indexes and missing indexes
- **Migration review** -- detect long-running DDL blocking production
- **Schema design review** -- timezone-naive timestamps, missing PKs, naming issues

**EXPLAIN plan capture**: Plans are captured on-demand via `sage.explain(queryid)`, which runs `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON, COSTS, VERBOSE)` against the query text from `pg_stat_statements` and caches the result. No `auto_explain` dependency required.

### Tier 3 -- Action Executor

Automated remediation with a graduated trust model:

| Trust Level | Timeline | Allowed Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **OBSERVATION** | Day 0--7 | No actions; findings only |
| **ADVISORY** | Day 8--30 | SAFE actions (drop unused/duplicate indexes, vacuum tuning) |
| **AUTONOMOUS** | Day 31+ | MODERATE actions (create indexes, reindex, configuration changes) |

HIGH-risk actions always require manual confirmation regardless of trust level.

Every autonomous action is logged to `sage.action_log` with before/after state and rollback SQL. The rollback checker monitors for p95 latency regressions and automatically reverts actions that degrade performance.

---

## SQL Functions

```sql
-- System status as JSONB
SELECT * FROM sage.status();

-- Daily health briefing (works with or without LLM)
SELECT * FROM sage.briefing();

-- Interactive diagnostic with ReAct reasoning (Tier 2)
SELECT * FROM sage.diagnose('Why are my queries slow today?');

-- Human-readable query plan narrative (Tier 2)
SELECT * FROM sage.explain(query_id);

-- Suppress a specific finding
SELECT sage.suppress(finding_id, 'Known issue, vendor fix pending', 30);

-- Emergency controls
SELECT sage.emergency_stop();   -- halt all autonomous activity immediately
SELECT sage.resume();           -- resume normal operation
```

---

## MCP Sidecar (v0.5)

pg_sage includes a thin Go sidecar that exposes the extension's capabilities via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) over HTTP+SSE. This lets AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot) interact with your database through pg_sage.

### Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────┐     MCP (JSON-RPC over SSE)     ┌─────────────────┐
│  AI Assistant / IDE  │ ◄──────────────────────────────► │  sage-sidecar   │
└──────────────────────┘          port 5433               │  (Go binary)    │
                                                          └────────┬────────┘
                                                                   │ SQL
                                                          ┌────────▼────────┐
                                                          │   PostgreSQL    │
                                                          │   + pg_sage     │
                                                          └─────────────────┘
```

The sidecar connects to PostgreSQL and calls SQL functions (`sage.health_json()`, `sage.findings_json()`, etc.) — no additional ports opened on the database.

### MCP Resources

| URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `sage://health` | System health overview (connections, cache hit ratio, disk, workers) |
| `sage://findings` | Open findings with severity, recommendations, and remediation SQL |
| `sage://schema/{table}` | DDL, indexes, constraints, columns, and foreign keys |
| `sage://stats/{table}` | Table size, row counts, dead tuples, vacuum status |
| `sage://slow-queries` | Top slow queries from pg_stat_statements |
| `sage://explain/{queryid}` | Cached EXPLAIN plan |

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `diagnose` | Interactive diagnostic analysis via ReAct reasoning |
| `briefing` | Generate an on-demand health briefing |
| `suggest_index` | Get index recommendations for a table |
| `review_migration` | Review DDL for production safety |

### Prometheus Metrics

The sidecar exposes Prometheus metrics at `:9187/metrics`:

- `pg_sage_info{version}` — Extension version
- `pg_sage_findings_total{severity}` — Open findings by severity
- `pg_sage_circuit_breaker_state{breaker}` — Circuit breaker status

### Running the Sidecar

```bash
docker compose up   # starts both pg_sage and the sidecar
```

Or standalone:

```bash
export SAGE_DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"
export SAGE_MCP_PORT=5433
export SAGE_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9187
cd sidecar && go build -o sage-sidecar . && ./sage-sidecar
```

### MCP SQL Functions (v0.5)

These SQL functions return JSONB and are used by the sidecar, but can also be called directly:

```sql
SELECT sage.health_json();                     -- system health overview
SELECT sage.findings_json();                   -- open findings
SELECT sage.findings_json('resolved');         -- resolved findings
SELECT sage.schema_json('public.orders');      -- table schema
SELECT sage.stats_json('public.orders');       -- table statistics
SELECT sage.slow_queries_json();               -- slow queries
SELECT sage.explain_json(queryid);             -- cached explain plan
```

---

## Grafana Dashboard

A pre-built Grafana dashboard is included at `grafana/pg_sage_dashboard.json` with 18 panels covering findings by severity, connections, cache hit ratio, TPS, deadlocks, circuit breaker status, and database size. See `grafana/README.md` for import instructions.

---

## Schema

All objects live in the `sage` schema:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sage.snapshots` | Point-in-time system state captures (indexes, tables, sequences, system) |
| `sage.findings` | Detected issues with severity, recommendation, and remediation SQL |
| `sage.action_log` | Audit trail for every autonomous action with rollback metadata |
| `sage.explain_cache` | Cached EXPLAIN plans keyed by queryid |
| `sage.briefings` | Generated briefing reports with delivery status |
| `sage.config` | Extension configuration overrides |
| `sage.mcp_log` | Audit log of MCP sidecar requests (v0.5) |

---

## Configuration (GUCs)

Set these in `postgresql.conf` or via `ALTER SYSTEM`:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sage.enabled` | `on` | Master enable/disable switch |
| `sage.collector_interval` | `30s` | Interval between snapshot collections |
| `sage.analyzer_interval` | `60s` | Interval between analysis runs |
| `sage.trust_level` | `observation` | Current trust tier (`observation`, `advisory`, `autonomous`) |
| `sage.slow_query_threshold` | `1s` | Slow query threshold |
| `sage.seq_scan_min_rows` | `100000` | Minimum table rows for sequential scan alerts |
| `sage.rollback_threshold` | `10` | p95 latency regression % that triggers automatic rollback |
| `sage.llm_enabled` | `off` | Enable Tier 2 LLM features (set to `on` after configuring `sage.llm_endpoint`) |

---

## Circuit Breaker

pg_sage includes a circuit breaker that protects your database from runaway analysis or action loops:

- **Separate breakers** for database operations and LLM calls
- Trips automatically when error thresholds are exceeded
- `sage.emergency_stop()` trips both breakers immediately
- `sage.resume()` resets breakers and resumes normal operation

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, or 17
- `pg_stat_statements` extension
- `libcurl` development headers (for optional LLM integration)

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up
```

The included `docker-compose.yml` configures `shared_preload_libraries`, `pg_stat_statements`, and default GUCs automatically.

### From Source

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Add to `postgresql.conf`:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,pg_sage'
sage.database = 'postgres'
```

Restart PostgreSQL, then:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_sage;
```

> **Note on managed services**: The pg_sage C extension requires `shared_preload_libraries` access, which is not available on RDS, Aurora, or Cloud SQL. The MCP sidecar (v0.5) provides a path toward managed database support in a future release by decoupling the protocol layer from the extension.

---

## Testing

Three test suites are included:

| Suite | Tests | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `test/regression.sql` | 27 | Core functionality and schema validation |
| `test/run_tests.sql` | 14 | Integration tests across tiers |
| `test/test_all_features.sql` | -- | Comprehensive feature coverage (all tiers) |

Run against the Docker container:

```bash
# Full feature test
docker exec -i pg_sage-pg_sage-1 psql -U postgres < test/test_all_features.sql

# Regression suite (27 pass/fail assertions)
docker exec -i pg_sage-pg_sage-1 psql -U postgres < test/regression.sql
```
